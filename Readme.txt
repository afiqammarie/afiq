Assignment 2
Verve Health - SDG 3 Wellness Platform

A comprehensive web platform dedicated to promoting **Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being based on assignment 2 from subject Graphic Interaction Design. This project features a modern, responsive design with a focus on community health, mental wellness, and global health news.

UI Style Guide

Based on the project design assets, the following style guide ensures brand consistency across all pages.

### 1. Color Palette
* **Primary Dark Green (`#002b1b`)**: Used for the Main Header, Hero sections, and primary branding elements.
* **Secondary Light Green (`#a8ffb2`)**: Used for section background transitions and campaign highlights.
* **Success Pastel Green (`#d1ffda`)**: Specifically used for success stories and past campaign cards.
* **Action Yellow (`#ffcc00`)**: Used for Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons, active navigation links, and the scroll-up icon.
* **Pure White (`#ffffff`)**: Used for card backgrounds and secondary sections to maintain readability.

### 2. Typography
* **Font Family**: 'Poppins'.
* **Main Headings (H1)**: Bold, heavy weight, sized at `5rem` to `6rem` for impact (e.g., "SDG 3", "Target").
* **Section Titles (H2)**: Bold, sized at `3.5rem` to `4rem`.
* **Body Text**: Clean, legible, with a line height of `1.6` to `1.7` for accessibility.

### 3. Component Standards
* **Buttons**: Rounded corners (`10px`), bold text, and Action Yellow background.
* **Cards**: Large border-radius (`20px` to `30px`) with soft drop shadows (`rgba(0,0,0,0.15)`).
* **Images**: All photographs use `object-fit: cover` to fill their containers without distortion.
* **Logos**: Partnership logos use `object-fit: contain` within white rounded boxes to ensure full visibility.

Project Structure

### Core Pages
1.  **Homepage**: Features the "SDG 3" Hero, an overlapping "About Us" card, and previews for Campaigns, Wellness, and News.
2.  **About Page**: Utilizes a "zigzag" split-layout (Target section text-left/image-right; Impact section image-left/text-right).
3.  **Wellness Tips**: A 3-column grid of educational resource cards with yellow "More Detail" buttons.
4.  **News Page**: A 3x3 photo-heavy grid featuring text overlays and category filters like "All Post" and "Press Release".
5.  **Contact Page**: Includes a 2-column contact form, a centered FAQ section, and a horizontal Partnership logo scroll.

Layout Techniques Used

* **Flexbox Centering**: Used to align headers and CTA buttons perfectly in the center of the viewport.
* **Grid System**: Powering the 3-column layouts for the Wellness and News sections to ensure uniform spacing.
* **Responsive Breakpoints**:
    * **Desktop**: Side-by-side split layouts and 3-column grids.
    * **Mobile (<768px)**: Flex-direction switches to `column`, stacking all elements vertically for better mobile usability.
